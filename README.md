# GamesHub  

**GamesHub** is a modular desktop application for classic games, designed with a microservice architecture. Each game is developed as a standalone project and seamlessly integrated into the hub, providing users with a unified experience for managing and playing games like Minesweeper.

**Coming Soon:** see my Portfolio Website ([joewilko17.github.io](https://joewilko17.github.io/)) for more content about how I have made this project, why I have made it and how I want to expand the project in the future.

## Features  

- **Game Integration**: Run executable files for classic games from the hub. Each game is a separate microservice project.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend the hub with additional games by integrating new microservices.  
- **Classic Game Library**: Provide various games to access and play.  

 ## Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Framework**: JavaFX for GUI  
- **Architecture**: Microservices with reusable MVC components  
- **Build Tool**: Maven for dependency and project management

## Key Objectives  

1. Create a professional, maintainable desktop application.  
2. Design and implement classic games using JavaFX.

## Future Plans

In my next version of the project, I am planning on adding the following features & changes:
- **Minesweeper UI Revision**: The game is currently in a bare minimum state considering UI, and I plan to update to a modern and clean looking UI design.
- **Gameshub UI Revision**: Elements such as the game cards within the library need styling, as well as more modern and consistent design overall.
- **Highscore and Achievement Integration**: I will be showcasing the highscores and achievements unlocked from games within the player profile (its currently a bit empty).
- **Refactor of FXML**: I will be changing the gameshub code from fxml javafx, to pure javafx.

## How to Run  

1. Navigate to the releases section and select v0.1.0-alpha
2. Download the Gameshub.rar (Note: Antivirus might flag the file as unsafe, this was due to an error when I built the executable file)
3. Run the Gameshub.exe executable file
